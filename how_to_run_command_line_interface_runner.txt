Notes and steps for getting the cucumber-jvm Command Line Interface (CLI) working.

the general syntax of the cucumber CLI is:

    java -cp <classpath: list of jars and project paths> cucumber.api.cli.Main <cucumber options> <fully qualified path to feature files>
    
This note assumes that you have imported your project into Eclipse IDE for Java Developers as a Maven project with the m2e 
plugin. You can adjust the build path by right-clicking on your project and selecting Build Path > Configure Build Path... 
Once the build path is configured correctly in Eclipse we need to extract it.

One way to extract the classpath is to insert: 

    System.out.println("** classpath: " + System.getProperty("java.class.path"));
    
into one of the step definition Given, When, or Than java blocks then execute that scenario using the JUnit runner. The
console output (Eclipse) will contain fully qualified paths to the jar dependencies. Copy the printed classpath and paste
it replacing <classpath: list of jars and project paths>.

Next add source code paths:

     /home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/main/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/main/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/test/resources/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*:

Note that the added paths end in /* and are separated by the OS specific classpath separator.  This was created on Centos7 so 
that seperator is a colon.

This concludes the classpath part (Thank goodness!)

Next (after cucumber.api.cli.Main) comes <cucumber options>. Refer to this [usage guide](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/blob/0aecc4d3e4c15fc34b63f848043deba2c230e35f/core/src/main/resources/cucumber/api/cli/USAGE.txt).
At a minimum at a glue step for your step definition package(s one --glue for each). Note you specify package names, not fully 
qualified paths. So for this projects the cucumber options are:

    --plugin json:target/cucumber-report.json --glue cucumber/examples/java/calculator
    
The last clause is the fully qualified path to the features directory.  Note that it does not end in "/*".

The full statement looks like:

    java -cp /home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/target/test-classes:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/target/classes:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/cucumber-jvm-deps/1.0.5/cucumber-jvm-deps-1.0.5.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/cucumber-java/1.2.4/cucumber-java-1.2.4.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/cucumber-core/1.2.4/cucumber-core-1.2.4.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/cucumber-html/0.2.3/cucumber-html-0.2.3.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/gherkin/2.12.2/gherkin-2.12.2.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/info/cukes/cucumber-testng/1.2.4/cucumber-testng-1.2.4.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/org/testng/testng/6.9.4/testng-6.9.4.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/org/beanshell/bsh/2.0b4/bsh-2.0b4.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/com/beust/jcommander/1.48/jcommander-1.48.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/surefire/surefire-testng-utils/2.17/surefire-testng-utils-2.17.jar:/home/mike/.m2/repository/org/apache/maven/surefire/surefire-grouper/2.17/surefire-grouper-2.17.jar:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/main/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/main/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*:/home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/test/resources/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/*: cucumber.api.cli.Main --plugin json:target/cucumber-report.json --glue cucumber/examples/java/calculator /home/mike/gitprojs/java-calculator-testng/src/test/resources/cucumber/examples/java/calculator/features
 
To execute the CLI open a bash terminal and cd <project root> then enter the full statement and press enter.
