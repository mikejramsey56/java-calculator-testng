##About#

This project is a 'Hello World!' for integrating cucumber-jvm and Testng.  It is taken from the
cucumber repository example [java-calculator-testng](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/java-calculator-testng). The plan is to extend this framework to see how far the technology can be pushed.

Java program **CliRunner** exercises the cucumber-jvm Command Line Interface (CLI) test runner. CliRunner allows you to bypass the JUint test runner. It was written to gain a fuller understanding of cucumber-jvm's CLI runner.
